  - Classes are blueprints for objects.
  - Objects are instances of classes.
- **Inheritance**:
  - Allows a class to inherit properties and behavior from another class.
- **Polymorphism**:
  - Refers to the ability of objects to take on multiple forms.
- **Abstraction**:
  - Hides complex implementation details behind a simple interface.
- **Encapsulation**:
  - Bundles data and methods that operate on the data into a single unit.

## Exception Handling Cheat Sheet
- **try-catch**:
  - Used to handle exceptions in Java.
- **throws**:
  - Declares that a method may throw certain exceptions.
- **finally**:
  - Executes code regardless of whether an exception is thrown.

## I/O Operations Cheat Sheet
- **File Handling**:
  - Reading and writing data to files.
- **Streams**:
  - Transfer data between a program and an I/O device.
- **Serialization**:
  - Converts objects into a byte stream for storage or transmission.

## Collections Framework Cheat Sheet
- **List**:
  - Ordered collection that allows duplicate elements.
- **Set**:
  - Collection that does not allow duplicate elements.
- **Map**:
  - Key-value pair collection.

## Generics Cheat Sheet
- **Generic Classes**:
  - Classes that can work with any data type.
- **Generic Methods**:
  - Methods that can operate on different types.
- **Wildcards**:
  - Represent an unknown type in generics.

## Lambdas Cheat Sheet
- **Lambda Expressions**:
  - Concise way to represent anonymous functions.
- **Functional Interfaces**:
  - Interfaces with a single abstract method.
- **Method References**:
  - Refers to methods or constructors without invoking them.

## JDBC Cheat Sheet
- **JDBC Drivers**:
  - Software components enabling Java applications to interact with databases.
- **Connection Establishment**:
  - Establishing a connection to a database.
- **Statement Execution**:
  - Executing SQL queries and updates.

## Annotations Cheat Sheet
- **Built-In Annotations**:
  - Annotations provided by Java for various purposes.
- **Custom Annotations**:
  - Annotations defined by users for specific requirements.
- **Annotation Processors**:
  - Tools that process annotations at compile time.

## Reflection Cheat Sheet
- **Class Reflection**:
  - Inspecting and modifying classes at runtime.
- **Method Reflection**:
  - Accessing and invoking methods dynamically.
- **Field Reflection**:
  - Reading and updating fields of a class.

## JVM Internals Cheat Sheet
- **Class Loading**:
  - Loading classes into memory dynamically.
- **Memory Management**:
  - Allocating and freeing memory for Java objects.
- **Garbage Collection**:
  - Identifying and reclaiming unused memory.

## Unit Testing with JUnit Cheat Sheet
- **Test Cases**:
  - Methods annotated with @Test to verify code behavior.
- **Assertions**:
  - Checking expected results using assert methods.
- **Annotations**:
  - @Before, @After, @BeforeEach, @AfterEach for setup and teardown.

## Security Cheat Sheet
- **Secure Coding Practices**:
  - Writing code that is resistant to vulnerabilities.
- **Encryption**:
  - Protecting data by converting it into a secure format.
- **Authentication**:
  - Verifying the identity of users or systems.

## Design Patterns Cheat Sheet
- **Creational Patterns**:
  - Patterns for object creation.
- **Structural Patterns**:
  - Patterns for object composition.
- **Behavioral Patterns**:
  - Patterns for object interaction.

## Best Practices Cheat Sheet
