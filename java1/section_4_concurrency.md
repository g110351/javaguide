# Section 4: Concurrency

Concurrency in Java allows multiple tasks to run in parallel, enhancing performance and responsiveness. This section covers key concepts and techniques for managing concurrent operations.

## Introduction to Concurrency
Concurrency vs. Parallelism:
- Concurrency enables tasks to make progress in overlapping time periods.
- Parallelism involves tasks running simultaneously on multiple processors.

## Thread Basics
Threads in Java:
- A thread represents an independent path of execution within a program.
- Threads share the same memory space but have their own execution stack.

Creating Threads:
```java
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        // Thread logic here
    }
}

MyThread thread = new MyThread();
thread.start();
```

## Synchronization
Synchronization in Java:
- Prevents multiple threads from accessing shared resources concurrently.
- Ensures data consistency and avoids race conditions.

Using synchronized keyword:
```java
public synchronized void synchronizedMethod() {
    // Synchronized method logic
}
```

## Thread Safety
Thread-safe Collections:
- Collections that can be safely accessed by multiple threads.
- Examples include ConcurrentHashMap, CopyOnWriteArrayList.

## Executors Framework
ExecutorService interface:
- Simplifies managing thread execution and provides thread pooling.
- Allows submitting tasks for asynchronous execution.

Using Executors:
```java
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5);
executor.submit(() -> {
    // Task logic here
});
executor.shutdown();
```

## Concurrency Utilities
Java.util.concurrent package:
- Provides high-level concurrency utilities like locks, semaphores, and barriers.
- Facilitates building efficient and scalable concurrent applications.

## Best Practices
- Use higher-level concurrency utilities over low-level constructs like wait/notify.
- Avoid excessive synchronization to prevent performance bottlenecks.
- Test concurrent code thoroughly to ensure correctness under varying conditions.

This concludes the Concurrency section, highlighting essential concepts and practices for effective concurrent programming in Java.
