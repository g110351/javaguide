# Case Studies

## Case Study 1: Implementing a Library Management System
In this case study, we will explore the development of a library management system using Java SE 11. The system will allow librarians to manage book inventory, track borrowing records, and handle user registrations.

```java
// Library Management System Implementation
public class LibraryManagementSystem {
    // Implementation details
}
```

## Case Study 2: Creating a Social Media Analytics Tool
In this case study, we will delve into the creation of a social media analytics tool using Java SE 11. The tool will analyze social media data, generate reports, and provide insights for marketing and engagement strategies.

```java
// Social Media Analytics Tool Implementation
public class SocialMediaAnalyticsTool {
    // Implementation details
}
```

## Case Study 3: Building a Stock Trading Platform
In this case study, we will showcase the development of a stock trading platform using Java SE 11. The platform will facilitate stock trading activities, real-time market data analysis, and portfolio management for traders.

```java
// Stock Trading Platform Implementation
public class StockTradingPlatform {
    // Implementation details
}
```

These case studies demonstrate the versatility and applicability of Java SE 11 in developing complex and feature-rich software systems. By studying and implementing such case studies, developers can gain valuable insights into real-world Java programming scenarios.
