# JVM Internals

## Overview
In this section, we will explore the internals of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), diving into its architecture and how it executes Java bytecode.

## Topics Covered
1. Introduction to JVM
2. Class Loading
3. Memory Management
4. Garbage Collection
5. Execution Engine

## Detailed Explanations

### Introduction to JVM
The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is an abstract computing machine that enables Java bytecode to be executed on different platforms. It provides features such as memory management, garbage collection, and security.

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

### Class Loading
Class loading is the process of loading class files into the JVM memory. The JVM dynamically loads classes as they are referenced during runtime.

```java
ClassLoader classLoader = MyClass.class.getClassLoader();
Class<?> myClass = classLoader.loadClass("com.example.MyClass");
```

### Memory Management
Memory management in the JVM involves allocating and deallocating memory for objects and data structures. The JVM manages memory through the use of the heap and stack.

```java
Object obj = new Object(); // Memory allocated on the heap
int x = 10; // Memory allocated on the stack
```

### Garbage Collection
Garbage collection is the process of reclaiming memory occupied by objects that are no longer in use. The JVM automatically runs the garbage collector to reclaim memory.

```java
Object obj = new Object();
obj = null; // Marking object for garbage collection
System.gc(); // Explicitly trigger garbage collection
```

### Execution Engine
The execution engine in the JVM interprets Java bytecode and executes it on the underlying hardware. It includes components such as the interpreter, just-in-time (JIT) compiler, and profiler.

```java
public class Calculation {
    public int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}
```

Understanding JVM internals is essential for optimizing Java applications and diagnosing performance issues.
